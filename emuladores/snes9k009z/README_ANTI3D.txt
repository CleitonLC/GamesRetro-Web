ABOUT 

This kailleraclient.dll is a standard Kaillera v0.9 dll that has been altered 
to use the Master Server list at www.anti3d.com instead of www.kaillera.com. 
This was done because (as of Sept 2005) the Kaillera website has been down for 
months, and as a result nobody is able to get a server list. Users wish to 
continue to use Kaillera; therefore the owner of Anti3D.com has started an 
alternative Kaillera Master Server.

Anti3D.com's Master Server is currently driven from Anti3D's TopServers list. 
Any server owner may freely Add their server to the list via the website, but 
no servers automatically update the list.

Should the original Master Server list at www.kaillera.com come back up 
sometime in the future, Anti3D.com's Master will act as a mirror so no 
confusion arrises between people with different versions of the dll.

INSTALL

Backup your existing kailleraclient.dll, which is in your emulator's home 
directory, and then unzip this file into the directory, overwriting 
kailleraclient.dll.
